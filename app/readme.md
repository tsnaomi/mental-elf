# *Mental Elf* web app

Welcome to the Mental Elf Flask app!

____

### Getting started

- Install the latest Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - This requires pip version 9.0.3, so type `pip -V` to check your pip version. If you have a never version of pip, run `pip install pip==9.0.3` inside your project's activated virtualenv to downgrade pip.
- Install ASK CLI: `npm install -g ask-cli` or `sudo npm install -g ask-cli`
- Initialize ASK CLI: `ask init`
- Go into your Alexa Skills Kit console and create a Mental Elf Dev skill (henceforth, dev-elf). This skill will only be used when *you* work on the project *locally*.
- Place `config.py` and `dev.sh` inside your project's `app` directory. *Never* commit these files.
  - In `config.py`, fill in `SKILL_ID` with your dev-elf's skill ID.
  - No need to change anything in `dev.sh` (yet).
- Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXL8FDUag-s&feature=youtu.be) and learn how to set up **ngrok** with the Alexa Skills Kit. Don't worry about the other stuff in the video.

### Running the web app locally

Inside the `app` directory:

1. Run `source dev.sh` to imbue your environment with the necessary variables.
   - Do this in any terminal window in which you'd like to interact with the web app.
2. <u>If it is your first time serving the web app locally</u>, run `flask upload_model`
3. In a separate terminal window, run `./ngrok http 5000` and use the given HTTPS url as dev-elf's endpoint in the Alexa Skills Kit console.
4. Run `flask run` to start the web server locally. *Voila!* Now you can test out Mental Elf in the Alexa Skills Kit console.
